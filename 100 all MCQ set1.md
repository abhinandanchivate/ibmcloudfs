Great — here are **10 real, very difficult, and non-repeating MCQs** (2 each from Java, Spring Boot, Angular, React, Docker, and Kubernetes):

---

### ✅ **\[Java] MCQ 1 — Generics & Wildcards**

```java
List<? extends Number> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
list.add(10);  // Line A
```

What happens at Line A?

| Option                                               | Explanation |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| A. Compiles and runs fine                            |             |
| B. Compilation error — can't add to `? extends` list |             |
| C. Runtime error                                     |             |
| D. Converts Integer to Number                        |             |

**✅ Correct Answer: B**

> You cannot add elements to `List<? extends Number>` because the compiler doesn't know the exact subtype.

### ✅ **\[Java] MCQ 2 — Stream Behavior**

```java
Stream.of("a", "b", "c")
      .peek(System.out::print)
      .map(String::toUpperCase)
      .count();
```

What is the output?

| Option                                    | Explanation |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| A. abc                                    |             |
| B. ABC                                    |             |
| C. No output                              |             |
| D. a, b, c printed with count return only |             |

**✅ Correct Answer: A**

> `peek()` runs during terminal operation (`count()`), prints lowercase values. `map` is executed but result not printed.

---

### ✅ **\[Spring Boot] MCQ 3 — Bean Lifecycle**

```java
@Bean
@Scope("prototype")
public MyService myService() {
    return new MyService();
}
```

What is true about `myService` bean?

| Option                                   | Explanation |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| A. Singleton by default                  |             |
| B. Same instance used for each injection |             |
| C. New instance on every injection       |             |
| D. Initialized once per context          |             |

**✅ Correct Answer: C**

> `@Scope("prototype")` ensures new bean instance per injection.

---

### ✅ **\[Spring Boot] MCQ 4 — Conditional Beans**

You define:

```java
@ConditionalOnMissingBean(MyService.class)
@Bean
public MyService myService() { ... }
```

What does this do?

| Option                           | Explanation |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- |
| A. Always creates MyService      |             |
| B. Replaces existing bean        |             |
| C. Skips bean if already defined |             |
| D. Throws exception if missing   |             |

**✅ Correct Answer: C**

> `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` only defines a bean if no other bean of that type exists.

---

### ✅ **\[Angular] MCQ 5 — Change Detection**

Component:

```ts
@Component({
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
```

What happens if `@Input()` data changes via mutation?

| Option                                  | Explanation |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| A. DOM updates automatically            |             |
| B. No change detection triggered        |             |
| C. Change detection runs on every event |             |
| D. Zone.js handles mutation             |             |

**✅ Correct Answer: B**

> OnPush doesn't track object mutation — it requires new reference to trigger detection.

---

### ✅ **\[Angular] MCQ 6 — AsyncPipe**

```html
<div *ngIf="data$ | async as data">
  {{ data.name }}
</div>
```

If `data$` is a `Subject` and not emitting values yet?

| Option                           | Explanation |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- |
| A. Template throws error         |             |
| B. Template renders empty        |             |
| C. `data` is undefined           |             |
| D. `data` is default object `{}` |             |

**✅ Correct Answer: B**

> Until `Subject` emits, async pipe returns `null` and hides content (via `*ngIf`).

---

### ✅ **\[React] MCQ 7 — useMemo Pitfall**

```jsx
const result = useMemo(() => computeExpensive(x), []);
```

If `x` changes but deps are `[]`?

| Option                                 | Explanation |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| A. Recomputes on every render          |             |
| B. Never recomputes                    |             |
| C. React throws warning                |             |
| D. Automatically updates on `x` change |             |

**✅ Correct Answer: B**

> `[]` means the memoized result never updates, even if `x` changes. Common bug.

---

### ✅ **\[React] MCQ 8 — State Batching**

```jsx
setCount(count + 1);
setCount(count + 1);
```

Initial `count = 0`. After both `setCount` calls, value is?

| Option         | Explanation |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| A. 2           |             |
| B. 1           |             |

---

### ✅ **\[Docker] MCQ 9 — Layer Caching**

In this Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y curl
```

You make a code change below these lines and rebuild. What happens?

| Option                                 | Explanation |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| A. All layers rebuild                  |             |
| B. Only bottom layers rebuilt          |             |
| C. `curl` not re-installed             |             |
| D. Cache is reused for `apt-get` steps |             |

**✅ Correct Answer: D**

> Docker reuses unchanged layers from cache unless something before changes.

---

### ✅ **\[Kubernetes] MCQ 10 — Readiness Probes**

Your app takes 10s to start. You apply:

```yaml
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 2
  periodSeconds: 5
```

What is true?

| Option                             | Explanation |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- |
| A. Pod marked ready after 2s       |             |
| B. May fail early readiness checks |             |
| C. Never becomes ready             |             |
| D. Container crashes               |             |

**✅ Correct Answer: B**

> `initialDelaySeconds` too short, so first few readiness probes may fail.

  }
}
```

If another thread does:

```java
synchronized(lock2) {
  synchronized(lock1) {
    // do something else
  }
}
```

What can this lead to?

> This is a classic deadlock — both threads wait on each other’s locks.

---

### ✅ **\[Java] MCQ 12 — Stream Short-Circuiting**

```java
Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
      .filter(x -> x > 2)

| D. They are mutually exclusive                 |             |

**✅ Correct Answer: C**

> `ApplicationRunner` receives structured arguments, while `CommandLineRunner` gets a raw array.

---

### ✅ **\[Angular] MCQ 15 — Zone.js Removal Impact**

If you remove Zone.js from Angular and run change detection manually, what stops working?

| Option                  | Explanation |

| D. RxJS Observables     |             |

**✅ Correct Answer: C**

> Without Zone.js, Angular doesn't automatically detect changes — `ChangeDetectorRef` must be used.

---

### ✅ **\[Angular] MCQ 16 — ViewEncapsulation Modes**

---

### ✅ **\[React] MCQ 17 — useEffect Cleanup**

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const id = setInterval(() => { ... }, 1000);
  return () => clearInterval(id);
}, []);
```

Why is the `clearInterval` call important?

| Option                   | Explanation |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| A. Prevents memory leaks |             |
| B. Improves rendering    |             |

| D. Only needed in class  |             |

**✅ Correct Answer: A**

> Without cleanup, the interval runs even after component unmounts — causing memory leaks.

---

```yaml
servers:
  - host: localhost
    port: 8080
  - host: 127.0.0.1

### ✅ **\[Docker] MCQ 30 — Volume Mount Behavior**

What happens when mounting a volume over a folder that already has data?

| Option                             | Explanation |
